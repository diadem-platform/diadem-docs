Conjugate ratio
=============
Conjugation is the overlap of one p-orbital with another across an adjacent Ïƒ bond,
resulting in the delocalization of pi electrons.

This property shows us the ratio of conjugated atoms/heavy atom count.
Conjugated atoms represent the number of atoms being part of the longest conjugated chain within the molecule.
To form such conjugation we considered the following atom types:
    - sp2 or sp3 carbon
    - Nitrogen
    - Oxygen
    - Phosphorus
    - Sulfur
