What is Stokes Shift
====================

The Stokes shift roughly equates to the shift between emission and absorbtion peak.
It influences OLED performance factors like self-absorbtion of photons or the efficiency of energy transfer,
particularly important in devices containing dyes of different colors.


Restriction
===========

In the lab, the solvent/environment can also affect the magnitude of the Stokes shift. If your molecule has a strong CT character, the vaccum calculation should only be understood as an estimate.
