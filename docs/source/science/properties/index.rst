Properties
===========

DiaDEM is built around properties computed for organic electronic materials: Users can search the :ref:`database <science_database>` for materials for a specific purpose based on precomputed or pre-estimated properties; On-demand computations provide properties that are too complex to compute for all materials but are essential to refine candidates from the database search. In the following you can find details of all properties that were either precomputed or are available for on-demand computations, including a description of available methods and benchmarks to experimental data.
