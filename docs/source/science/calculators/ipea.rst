IPEA (Ionization potential and electron affinity)
=================================================

Output
--------
This calculator computes ionization potential and electron affinity of organic electronic materials *in their thin film phase*, i.e. taking into account polarization effects.

All outputs:

* :ref:`science_properties_ipea`
* :ref:`science_properties_polarizationenergy`
* :ref:`science_properties_permittivity`

plus all outputs of the :ref:`science_calculators_morphology`.

Method
