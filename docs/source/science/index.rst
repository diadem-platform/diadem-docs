Introduction: Database, Calculators and Properties
========================================

.. note::

    Coming soon: Detailed information on the database, available compounds, computed properties and methods for both precomputed properties and on-demand computations.

This section contains the following information:

- The :ref:`Database section <science_database>` contains information on compounds available in the database including recent updates to the database.
- In the :ref:`Properties section <science_properties>` you will find information on both the molecular properties that are provided in the database for queries and the more advanced molecular properties that can be computed on-demand, along with references to the methods and corresponding benchmarks.
- The :ref:`Calculators section <science_calculators>` comprises information on the various calculators (implemented methods) that are used to compute molecular properties or were applied to populate the database.
