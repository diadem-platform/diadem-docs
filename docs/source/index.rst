Welcome to the DiaDEM documentation
===================================

**DiaDEM** is a platform for organic electronics providing a one-stop-shop solution from digital discovery to experimental verification by linking the virtual screening of small molecule candidates with the chemical supply chain. Much like novel lead compounds are explored in the drug discovery industry, the field of organic semiconductors, needs to extend the palette of suitable structures for light emitting diodes, photovoltaics, transistors, sensors etc.

The (current) beta version of the DiaDEM platform is available at https://www.diadem-staging.de

A detailed description of the DiaDEM project is available at https://www.diadem-project.de

This page is the official documentation for the DiaDEM platform including user guide and scientific documentation. It is structured as follows:
