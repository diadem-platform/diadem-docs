Login options
----------------
The web frontend displays various login options with third party authentication (facebook, X, google) that we envision for the future. However, these are not yet connected so sign-up for a DiaDEM user account is required. You can log onto DiaDEM with your email address and password after signup.

Signup
---------
Click on the "Signup" button in the top right header of the platform. Provide your email address and a password. Password requirements are: 

* minimum 8 characters 
* minimum 1 upper case character
* minimum 1 lower case character
* minimum 1 numeric character (a number)
* minimum 1 symbol

.. note::

    During the beta-testing phase (until early 2025), access to the platform is restricted. To greenlight your access, please contact us at info@nanomatch.com from the email-address you signed up with. After you have been greenlighted, please logout of the platform and re-login to access the full functionality
