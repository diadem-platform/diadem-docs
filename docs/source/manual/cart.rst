Purchase of compounds
======================

Adding molecules to your cart
------------------------------

You can add molecules to the cart in multiple ways: 

* From the query results page: Select multiple molecules via the check boxes and press *Add to cart*
* From the molecule-details page of a single molecule that appears whenever you clicked on a smiles link or InChIKey link.

Purchase of compounds
---------------------
As prices on the DiaDEM platform are indicative prices and both actual price and availability may change on short notice, you can purchase compounds by first requesting a quote from our partner MCule via the shopping cart which is available in the top right of the navigation bar.

Adapt the amount of units you would like to purchase, fill in the contact details, press the *Request Quote* button at the bottom of the page and follow the subsequent instructions.
