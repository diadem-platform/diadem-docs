Credits
=========

The DiaDEM credit sytem
------------------------

Certain fees are connected with your usage of DiaDEM services:

* a small fee is connected with each database query
* the fee for on-demand computation is aligned with the computational cost of the respective method

To simplify the usage especially with respect to the small fees for database queries we set up a credit system. You can purchase credits via the Profile page (see below) and use those credits to access DiaDEM services: A single credit is required to conduct a single query on the database; credits to conduct on-demand computation vary between methods and are displayed when setting up on-demand computations. For every interaction during which credits are deducted from your account, you will be promted for confirmation.

Purchasing credits
------------------
You can purchase credits via the profile page, accessible via the side menu. Go to


.. code-block:: javascript

    Profile -> Account Information -> Buy Credits


Credits are available in chunks of 100 à 10€ (status 09/2024). Select the number of 100 credits chunks and proceed either via PayPal or credit card.


Vouchers and coupons
--------------------
If you received a coupon code or voucher for free credits, select the number of credits indicated on the voucher and click "Add discount" in the left side of the checkout-popup. Enter the coupon code (no spaces, typically) and click "Apply". If your code is valid for the number of credits you are trying to purchase, no credit card information or checkout via PayPal is needed.
